# STEELER Logbook Sync Worker Prototype

This folder contains the isolated Cloudflare Worker prototype for the v1.2.0 data sync stream.

The browser app calls this Worker manually from Settings for sync checks, manual sync preview, one-way cloud backup uploads, read-only backup listing, selected backup JSON download, and guarded cloud-backup restore. It is still deliberately conservative: there is no automatic sync or merge path yet.

Staging Worker URL:

https://steeler-logbook-sync.bill-merry-52f.workers.dev
```

## Intended Shape

- Cloudflare Worker exposes a small private JSON API.
- D1 stores sync records as JSON payloads plus searchable metadata.
- The browser app remains offline-first and keeps using local storage.
- Manual STEELER data backup/restore remains the safety net.
- Authentication starts with one private bearer token.

## Endpoints

- `GET /health` is public and returns a simple health response.
- `GET /v1/status` requires auth and returns record/client counts.
- `GET /v1/records/summary?includeBackups=0&limit=500` requires auth and returns sync-record metadata only, without heavy payloads.
- `GET /v1/backups?limit=5` requires auth and returns recent cloud backup summaries only.
- `GET /v1/backups/{recordId}` requires auth and returns one complete backup JSON payload for download or guarded manual restore.
- `GET /v1/records?since=0&limit=100` requires auth and pulls changed records by server revision.
- `POST /v1/records/push` requires auth and upserts records.

Auth can use either:

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `X-STEELER-Sync-Token: <token>`

The token should be stored as a Worker secret named `SYNC_API_TOKEN`.

## Setup Notes

1. Create a D1 database for production.
2. Replace `database_id` in `wrangler.toml`.
3. Set the token:

   ```sh
   wrangler secret put SYNC_API_TOKEN
   ```

4. Apply migrations:

   ```sh
   npm run d1:migrate:remote
   ```

5. Deploy:

   ```sh
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Important

This prototype is connected only for manual sync checks, manual sync preview, one-way backup upload, backup listing, backup JSON download, and guarded cloud-backup restore. Do not treat the Worker as a production sync authority until the next stages add client-side sync push/pull, conflict handling, and multi-device testing.
