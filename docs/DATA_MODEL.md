# STEELER Logbook Data Model

This document records the local data shapes used by the v1.2.0 sync-foundation build. It began as the v0.11.5 baseline documentation and has been updated as the architecture foundation work added safety mirrors, modules, v0.20.x sea-use tweaks, reusable Detailed Passage Plan templates, and the first offline-first sync preparation fields.

The app is an offline-first browser PWA. User data is stored in `localStorage` as JSON strings, except for the theme value. Storage keys and data shapes must not be changed without an explicit migration plan and backup/restore testing.

## localStorage Keys

| Key | Purpose | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `steeler_logbook_passages_v5` | Passage plans, detailed passage plans, log entries, and finish state | JSON array of passage objects |
| `steeler_logbook_theme_v1` | UI theme | Plain string, usually `day` or `night` |
| `steeler_logbook_ports_v1` | Saved ports, coordinates, comms/pilotage notes, and recent ports | JSON object `{ "all": Port[], "recent": string[] }`; legacy array is still accepted on load |
| `steeler_safety_emergency_info_v1` | Vessel, safety, owner, emergency contacts, and notification defaults | JSON safety info object |
| `steeler_ec_settings_v1` | Legacy emergency contact settings | JSON legacy object; migrated into safety info when present |
| `STEELER_ABBR_DB_V1` | Weather abbreviation database and user edits | JSON abbreviation database; flat and legacy grouped shapes are accepted |
| `steeler_dpp_templates_v1` | Globally reusable Detailed Passage Plan templates | JSON `DppTemplateStore` object |
| `steeler_dpp_waypoints_v1` | Globally reusable Detailed Passage Plan waypoints | JSON `DppWaypointStore` object |
| `steeler_fuel_management_v1` | Fuel tank/reset settings | JSON fuel management object |
| `steeler_log_split_ratio_v1` | Log/plan split layout preference | Plain string number |
| `steeler_device_id_v1` | Local device/client identity for future sync | Plain string generated locally; not restored from data backups |
| `steeler_sync_status_v1` | Local sync status summary | JSON object; records local changes, Worker checks, and one-way cloud backup status |
| `steeler_sync_config_v1` | Staging sync connection settings | JSON object containing Worker URL and local token; not included in full data backups |

## Safety Mirror Keys

The v0.14.0 data safety pass adds separate last-known-good mirror keys. These do not replace or change the primary data keys above.

| Key | Mirrors |
| --- | --- |
| `steeler_lkg_passages_v5` | `steeler_logbook_passages_v5` |
| `steeler_lkg_passages_v5_meta` | Mirror metadata for passages |
| `steeler_lkg_ports_v1` | `steeler_logbook_ports_v1` |
| `steeler_lkg_ports_v1_meta` | Mirror metadata for ports |
| `steeler_lkg_safety_emergency_info_v1` | `steeler_safety_emergency_info_v1` |
| `steeler_lkg_safety_emergency_info_v1_meta` | Mirror metadata for safety info |
| `steeler_lkg_ec_settings_v1` | `steeler_ec_settings_v1` |
| `steeler_lkg_ec_settings_v1_meta` | Mirror metadata for legacy EC settings |
| `steeler_lkg_abbr_db_v1` | `STEELER_ABBR_DB_V1` |
| `steeler_lkg_abbr_db_v1_meta` | Mirror metadata for weather abbreviations |
| `steeler_lkg_dpp_templates_v1` | `steeler_dpp_templates_v1` |
| `steeler_lkg_dpp_templates_v1_meta` | Mirror metadata for DPP templates |

Mirror metadata has this shape:

```js
{
  sourceKey: "steeler_logbook_passages_v5",
  label: "passages",
  mirroredAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  appVersion: "0.14.0-staging"
}
```

If a primary key cannot be parsed, the app shows visible recovery handling and offers to export the raw stored value before recovery. The primary key is not renamed, and any last-known-good restore writes back to the same canonical key. The raw corrupt export has this shape:

```js
{
  format: "steeler-corrupt-localstorage-export",
  version: 1,
  exportedAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  appVersion: "0.14.0-staging",
  key: "steeler_logbook_passages_v5",
  label: "passages",
  error: "Unexpected token ...",
  raw: "{ damaged JSON"
}
```

## Passage

Stored inside `steeler_logbook_passages_v5`.

```js
{
  id: "p_...",
  flags: {
    engineStart: false,
    slip: false,
    dock: false
  },
  plan: PassagePlan,
  entries: LogEntry[],
  finish: PassageFinish,
  createdAt: "2026-05-03T08:00:00.000Z",
  updatedAt: "2026-05-03T08:00:00.000Z",
  schemaVersion: 1,
  lastModifiedDeviceId: "device_...",
  deleted: false,
  deletedAt: "",
  syncDirty: true,
  syncStatus: "pending",
  dirtyAt: "2026-05-03T08:00:00.000Z",

  // Optional fields added by later workflows
  pob: "4",
  legEnds: PassageLegEnd[]
}
```

Deleted passages are soft-deleted for sync safety. The app hides passages where `deleted === true` from normal Home and Log views, but keeps them in `steeler_logbook_passages_v5` and full data backups so the deletion can sync to other devices.

## PassagePlan

```js
{
  date: "2026-05-03",
  timeZone: "Europe/London",
  from: "Lymington",
  to: "Cherbourg",
  fromPortId: "port_...",      // optional
  toPortId: "port_...",        // optional
  transitPorts: [
    { name: "Cowes", portId: "port_..." }
  ],

  vessel: "STEELER",
  skipper: "",
  crew: "",
  sunriseSet: "",
  moonPhase: "",
  moonRiseSet: "",
  tidalCoeff: "",
  tideStations: TideStation[],
  currents: "",
  weather: "",
  comms: "",
  engineHoursStart: "",
  fuelStartPercent: "",
  engineStartEnv: EngineStartEnvironment,
  dailySummaries: DailySummary[],

  // Legacy first-leg detailed plan plus current multi-leg model.
  detailed: DetailedPassagePlan,
  detailedLegs: DetailedPassagePlan[],
  detailedLegIndex: 0
}
```

`transitPorts` may be absent or may contain legacy strings in older data. The current code normalises them to `{ name, portId }` objects and caps them at three transit ports.

`timeZone` stores the passage's operational time zone as an IANA zone id. New passages default from the device time zone where it maps to a supported choice. Supported UI choices are currently shown as `BST` (`Europe/London`), `GMT / UTC` (`UTC`), and `CET` (`Europe/Paris`). Older passages may not have this field and are treated as `Europe/London`.

## TideStation

```js
{
  id: "ts_...",
  name: "Cherbourg",
  role: "origin" | "transit1" | "transit2" | "transit3" | "dest" | "",
  hw1: "06:12",
  hw2: "18:24",
  lw1: "12:34",
  lw2: "",
  hw1h: "5.4",
  hw2h: "5.1",
  lw1h: "1.2",
  lw2h: "",
  events: [
    { type: "HW", time: "06:12", height: 5.4 }
  ],
  raw: "",
  source: "imray",
  auto: true
}
```

Tide stations are planned data. Manual fields are the editable source of truth; `events`, `raw`, and `source` support paste/import workflows and backwards compatibility.

## DailySummary

```js
{
  id: "ds_...",
  date: "2026-05-03",
  fee: "",
  notes: ""
}
```

## DetailedPassagePlan

```js
{
  waypoints: DetailedWaypoint[],
  hazards: "",
  portsOfRefuge: "",
  crewWelfare: ""
}
```

## DetailedWaypoint

```js
{
  id: "wp_...",
  time: "08:30",
  name: "Needles Fairway",
  coordsText: "50º39.000'N, 001º35.000'W",
  lat: 50.65,
  lon: -1.583333,
  distToNext: 12.4,
  manualDistToNext: "",
  cogToNext: "187",
  plannedSpeed: "8.0",
  timeToNext: "01:33",
  fuelToNext: 21.7
}
```

`distToNext`, `cogToNext`, `timeToNext`, and `fuelToNext` are recalculated from coordinates and planned speed. They are stored in passage data today, but should be treated as derived values. `manualDistToNext` can override the calculated distance for the leg starting at that waypoint, for example where a river route is longer than the straight-line waypoint distance.

## DppTemplateStore

Stored separately from passages in `steeler_dpp_templates_v1`. These templates are global reusable copies of a single leg's Detailed Passage Plan. Applying a template replaces the currently selected leg's DPP only after confirmation and does not change the passage route, storage keys, or passage data shape.

```js
{
  version: 1,
  updatedAt: "2026-05-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  templates: DppTemplate[]
}
```

## DppTemplate

```js
{
  id: "dpp_tpl_...",
  name: "Lymington to Bembridge",
  createdAt: "2026-05-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  updatedAt: "2026-05-04T12:10:00.000Z",
  detailed: DetailedPassagePlan
}
```

DPP templates include waypoint planned speeds plus the leg-specific `hazards`, `portsOfRefuge`, and `crewWelfare` fields. When a template is used, waypoint IDs are regenerated for the target leg so the saved template remains independent of the passage.

## DppWaypointStore

Stored separately from passages in `steeler_dpp_waypoints_v1`.

```js
{
  version: 1,
  updatedAt: "2026-05-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  waypoints: DppSavedWaypoint[]
}
```

## DppSavedWaypoint

```js
{
  id: "dpp_wp_...",
  name: "Needles Fairway",
  coordsText: "50º39.000'N, 001º35.000'W",
  lat: 50.65,
  lon: -1.583333,
  notes: "",
  createdAt: "2026-05-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  updatedAt: "2026-05-04T12:10:00.000Z"
}
```

## LogEntry

```js
{
  id: "e_...",
  time: "2026-05-03T08:30",
  leg: 0,
  lat: "50º45.123'N",
  lon: "001º18.456'W",
  course: "180",
  speed: "8.2",
  stw: "7.8",
  rpm: "1800",
  engTP: "82/3.1",
  waterLog: "123.4",
  groundLog: "125.1",
  fuelUsed: "",
  notes: "",
  entryType: "manual" | "engine-start" | "shutdown",
  createdAt: "2026-05-03T08:30:00.000Z",
  updatedAt: "2026-05-03T08:30:00.000Z",
  schemaVersion: 1,
  lastModifiedDeviceId: "device_...",
  deleted: false,
  deletedAt: "",
  syncDirty: true,
  syncStatus: "pending",
  dirtyAt: "2026-05-03T08:30:00.000Z",

  // Engine-start/shutdown workflows may also store typed copies.
  fuelStartPercentR: "",
  fuelStartPercentC: "",
  engineHoursStart: "",
  pob: "",
  engineStartEnv: EngineStartEnvironment,
  engineHoursEnd: "",
  fuelEndPercentR: "",
  fuelEndPercentC: "",
  shutdownNotes: ""
}
```

Manual log entries are the source of truth. Future live/NMEA values may prefill dialogs, but should not replace saved manual entries.

Deleted log entries are soft-deleted for v1.2.0 sync safety. The app hides entries where `deleted === true` from normal log views, counts, summaries, CSV export and PDF/print export, but keeps them in `steeler_logbook_passages_v5` and full data backups. This lets a later sync stage distinguish "deleted intentionally" from "missing because this device is old".

`syncDirty`, `syncStatus`, and `dirtyAt` are local sync-preparation fields. They mark records that have changed locally and need future sync processing. They do not currently contact a server.

## EngineStartEnvironment

```js
{
  airPressureMb: "",
  humidityPct: "",
  airTempC: "",
  seaTempC: "",
  windDir: "",
  windBft: "",
  notes: ""
}
```

## PassageFinish

```js
{
  engineHoursEnd: "",
  fuelEndPercent: "",
  notes: "",
  shutdownLogged: false
}
```

## PassageLegEnd

```js
{
  engineHoursEnd: "",
  fuelEndPercent: "",
  fuelEndPercentC: "",
  waterLog: "",
  groundLog: "",
  fuelUsed: "",
  notes: "",
  at: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Port

Stored inside `steeler_logbook_ports_v1.data.all`.

```js
{
  id: "port_...",
  name: "Cherbourg",
  lat: 49.642,
  lon: -1.622,
  commsPilotage: "",
  createdAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  updatedAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  schemaVersion: 1,
  lastModifiedDeviceId: "device_..."
}
```

Older data may contain strings or objects without ids. The current app normalises known ports on load and removes legacy `tideId` fields.

## SafetyEmergencyInfo

Stored in `steeler_safety_emergency_info_v1`.

```js
{
  vessel: {
    boatName: "STEELER",
    boatType: "Motor Yacht",
    boatModel: "",
    callsign: "",
    mmsi: "",
    ukSsr: "",
    marineTrafficShipId: "",
    homePort: "",
    length: "",
    beam: "",
    draft: ""
  },
  appearanceSafety: {
    topsides: "",
    hull: "",
    superstructure: "",
    liferaft: "",
    dinghy: "",
    lifejackets: "",
    epirb: "",
    safetyEquip: "",
    rnEquip: ""
  },
  owner: {
    names: "",
    tel: "",
    email: "",
    address: ""
  },
  emergencyContacts: EmergencyContact[],
  defaults: {
    overdueHours: 2,
    engineToSlipMins: 7,
    detailsPageUrl: "",
    includeDetailsUrlInSms: true,
    includeMarineTrafficInSms: true
  }
}
```

## EmergencyContact

```js
{
  id: "ec_...",
  name: "Emergency Contact",
  tel: "",
  email: "",
  notes: "",
  isDefault: true
}
```

Exactly one contact should be default after normalisation.

## Legacy EcSettings

Stored in `steeler_ec_settings_v1` and migrated into safety info when found.

```js
{
  emergencyContact: {
    name: "",
    tel: "",
    email: "",
    overdueHours: 2
  },
  vesselProfile: {
    boatName: "STEELER",
    boatType: "Motor Yacht",
    callsign: "",
    mmsi: "",
    detailsUrl: ""
  },
  passageDefaults: {
    engineToSlipMins: 7
  }
}
```

## WeatherAbbreviationDb

Stored in `STEELER_ABBR_DB_V1`. The current code accepts a legacy grouped shape and migrates it to a flat shape.

```js
{
  version: 2,
  seededFromDefaults: true,
  updatedAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  rules: [
    {
      id: "mo_001",
      from: "\\bSOUTH\\s+OR\\s+SOUTHEAST\\b",
      to: "S/SE",
      mode: "regex",
      enabled: true,
      flags: "g",
      provider: "metoffice",
      category: "wind",
      builtIn: true
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules are applied in stored order. User edits must be preserved when shipped defaults are merged.

## FuelManagementSettings

Stored in `steeler_fuel_management_v1`.

```js
{
  tankCapacity: 2000,
  resetAt: "2026-05-03T12:00",
  resetLevel: 2000
}
```

## Backup Payloads

Primary full data backup:

```js
{
  format: "steeler-data-backup",
  version: 1,
  schemaVersion: 1,
  exportedAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  appVersion: "1.2.0-rc5",
  exportedByDeviceId: "device_...",
  data: {
    passages: Passage[],
    theme: "day",
    knownPorts: {
      all: Port[],
      recent: string[]
    },
    safetyInfo: SafetyEmergencyInfo,
    legacyEcSettings: EcSettings,
    dppTemplates: DppTemplateStore,
    dppWaypoints: DppWaypointStore,
    weatherAbbreviations: WeatherAbbreviationDb,
    fuelManagement: FuelManagementSettings,
    settings: {
      logSplitRatio: "42"
    },
    localSyncStatus: {
      version: 1,
      deviceId: "device_...",
      syncEnabled: false,
      status: "local-pending",
      lastLocalChangeAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
      lastSyncAt: "",
      lastSyncError: "",
      pendingLocalChanges: 4
    }
  }
}
```

The primary data backup is the preferred v1.2.0 archive/restore format. It includes all local STEELER data needed for a full-device restore. `localSyncStatus` is included for diagnostics, but restore does not replace the destination device's `steeler_device_id_v1` or use the backup's sync status as a cloud authority.

When the manual Settings action sends a cloud backup, the app wraps this same payload in a sync Worker record:

```js
{
  recordType: "cloud-backup",
  payload: {
    format: "steeler-cloud-backup-record",
    version: 1,
    createdAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
    appVersion: "1.2.0",
    deviceId: "device_...",
    backup: SteelerDataBackup
  }
}
```

This is an archive copy only. It does not pull records back from Cloudflare and does not merge or overwrite local data.

The read-only cloud backup list is returned by `/v1/backups` and contains summary fields only:

```js
{
  recordId: "cloud_backup_...",
  createdAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  appVersion: "1.2.0",
  deviceId: "device_...",
  passageCount: 4,
  serverUpdatedAt: "2026-05-03 12:00:01",
  serverRevision: 12
}
```

This list does not include the full backup JSON and is not used for restore.

The selected cloud backup download is returned by `/v1/backups/{recordId}`:

```js
{
  ok: true,
  recordId: "cloud_backup_...",
  backup: SteelerDataBackup,
  summary: {
    createdAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
    appVersion: "1.2.0",
    deviceId: "device_...",
    serverUpdatedAt: "2026-05-03 12:00:01",
    serverRevision: 12
  }
}
```

The app writes `backup` to a downloaded JSON file when Download Backup is used. Restore Backup uses the same response, downloads a local safety backup first, requires two confirmations, and then applies `backup` through the normal `steeler-data-backup` restore path. The destination device keeps its own `steeler_device_id_v1`.

## Sync Records

Manual Sync Preview builds local sync records, but does not upload or apply them yet. These records are intended to cover all local STEELER data:

```js
{
  recordId: "passage:p_...",
  recordType: "passage",
  schemaVersion: 1,
  clientUpdatedAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  lastChangedDeviceId: "device_...",
  deleted: false,
  payload: {
    format: "steeler-sync-record",
    version: 1,
    appVersion: "1.2.0",
    recordType: "passage",
    updatedAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
    data: Passage
  }
}
```

Global record ids currently include `global:ports`, `global:safety-info`, `global:legacy-ec-settings`, `global:dpp-templates`, `global:dpp-waypoints`, `global:weather-abbreviations`, `global:fuel-management`, and `global:app-settings`.

The Worker summary endpoint `/v1/records/summary` returns record metadata only. It is used to preview how many records are safe to send, safe to receive, or need review without moving the actual record payloads.

A record needs review when the same record exists locally and in cloud, the timestamps differ, and the last-changed device ids differ. Manual send/receive leaves these records untouched.

Review items are resolved one at a time. Choosing "Keep this device" posts the selected local sync record to `/v1/records/push`. Choosing "Use cloud" first downloads a safety backup, then applies only the selected cloud sync record locally.

Full Sync combines the existing safe send and safe receive operations. It does not resolve needs-review records automatically.

Send Sync Records posts selected local sync records to `/v1/records/push`. After the Worker accepts every selected record, local `syncDirty` flags are cleared for the accepted passages, log entries, and ports. This marks those local changes as sent, but does not receive or merge remote records.

Receive Sync Records uses `/v1/records` to fetch full cloud records, filters them to the records shown in the Receive preview, downloads a local safety backup, and applies only those selected records. It can receive passages and the global record types listed above. It does not send local records.

Legacy full logbook backup:

```js
{
  format: "steeler-logbook-backup",
  version: 3,
  exportedAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  data: {
    passages: Passage[],
    theme: "day",
    safetyInfo: SafetyEmergencyInfo,
    dppTemplates: DppTemplateStore
  }
}
```

`dppTemplates` and `dppWaypoints` are optional for backwards compatibility. Backups created before v1.0.1 do not include DPP templates and still restore normally. Restoring a legacy full logbook backup preserves current ports.

Legacy ports backup:

```js
{
  format: "steeler-ports-backup",
  version: 1,
  exportedAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  data: {
    knownPorts: {
      all: Port[],
      recent: string[]
    }
  }
}
```

DPP Templates backup:

```js
{
  format: "steeler-dpp-templates-backup",
  version: 2,
  exportedAt: "2026-05-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  data: {
    dppTemplates: DppTemplateStore,
    dppWaypoints: DppWaypointStore
  }
}
```

DPP Template import merges by template name: matching names are updated, and new names are added.

## Migration Rules

- Do not rename localStorage keys without a migration.
- Do not change passage, log, port, safety, or abbreviation data shape without migration and restore testing.
- When adding fields, make readers tolerant of missing values.
- Keep manual saved log entries as the source of truth.
- Before destructive imports or migrations, preserve a way to export or recover the previous raw data.
- `js/safety-emergency.js` owns Safety/Emergency defaults, contact normalisation and legacy EC migration, but it preserves the keys and shapes documented above.
- `js/live-data.js` is currently a no-op boundary for future NMEA/liveData. It must not write saved log entries or replace manually entered passage data.
