# Release Checklist

Use this checklist for each STEELER Logbook release. The goal is to avoid stale PWA assets and to confirm that the offline-at-sea path is safe before tagging GitHub.

## Version Alignment

Before release, confirm these all describe the same intended release:

- `APP_VERSION` in `app.js`
- `CACHE_NAME` in `service-worker.js`
- Git commit message or release PR title
- GitHub tag name, for example `v0.12.0`
- Any release notes or backup filename expectations

`APP_VERSION` is displayed in the footer. `CACHE_NAME` controls the PWA cache bucket. When app assets change for a released build, bump both together.

## Pre-Release Code Checks

- Run JavaScript syntax checks for `app.js`, `service-worker.js`, and every `js/*.js` module.
- Run JavaScript syntax checks for `sync-worker/src/index.js` when the sync Worker changes.
- Confirm `git status` is clean except for intentional release changes.
- Review the diff for accidental storage-key, service-worker, data-shape, or core-flow changes.
- Confirm `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` still matches any intentional storage/data additions.
- Confirm `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` still matches the module list loaded by `index.html`.
- If `sync-worker/` changes, review `sync-worker/migrations/` and confirm the browser app is not connected to remote sync unless that is intentional.

## PWA / Offline Checks

Test from a clean browser profile or an iPad where possible:

1. Load the app online.
2. Confirm the footer shows the expected app version.
3. Create or open a passage.
4. Turn off network access.
5. Reload the installed PWA or browser tab.
6. Confirm Home, Plan, Log, Settings, dialogs, and existing data still open.
7. Add a manual log entry while offline.
8. Confirm the entry remains after closing and reopening the app offline.
9. Confirm Backup export still downloads a JSON file.
10. Restore network and reload.
11. Confirm data created offline is still present.

## Service Worker Update Checks

- Install or load the previous release.
- Open the new release.
- Confirm the app updates to the new footer version.
- If Safari/iPad appears stale, use the app reset path with `?reset=1`.
- Confirm reset clears only service-worker/cache storage and does not delete logbook localStorage data.
- Confirm the app shell, all loaded JavaScript modules, `styles.css`, `manifest.json`, icons, favicon, and the shipped `STEELER-safety-emergency-details.html` page are present in the service-worker asset list.

## Backup / Restore Checks

- Export a full STEELER data backup.
- Confirm full data backup includes passages, ports, Safety / Emergency Info, DPP templates, saved waypoints, weather abbreviations, fuel settings and app settings.
- Restore the full data backup and confirm all included data returns.
- Export a ports backup.
- Export a DPP Templates backup.
- Restore an older full logbook backup and confirm passages and Safety / Emergency Info return while current ports are left unchanged.
- Import the ports backup and confirm ports merge by name.
- Import the DPP Templates backup and confirm templates merge by name.
- Edit a Detailed Passage Plan template in Settings and confirm applying it to a passage uses the edited waypoints, speeds and notes.
- Confirm the destination device keeps its own `steeler_device_id_v1` after restoring a data backup.
- Delete a log entry and confirm it disappears from normal Log view, CSV export and PDF/print export while remaining present in the full data backup with `deleted: true`.
- Delete a passage on one device, run Full Sync on both devices, and confirm the passage stays deleted rather than reappearing from cloud.
- Confirm Settings > Data & Backup shows local sync status, pending local changes, recoverable deleted entries, last local change time and a device ID.
- Enter the sync Worker URL/token, tap Check Sync, and confirm it reports Worker OK without changing passage data.
- Tap Preview Sync and confirm it reports local/cloud sync-record counts plus safe-send, safe-receive, and needs-review counts without uploading, downloading into the app, restoring, merging, or changing local passage data.
- Edit one shared settings record, such as Ports, DPP templates, weather abbreviations or fuel settings, and confirm Preview Sync shows a useful summary of what changed.
- Add a URL to a log note or DPP note and confirm it displays as a clickable link.
- Override a DPP leg distance and confirm the total distance/time/fuel use the manual NM value.
- Confirm Advanced sync tools can be expanded and contain Check Sync, one-way Send/Receive, and cloud backup controls.
- For one needs-review item, choose either Keep this device or Use cloud. Confirm only that one item is resolved and the other needs-review items are left alone. If using cloud, confirm a safety backup downloads first.
- Tap Full Sync and confirm it sends only safe-send records, receives only safe-receive records, downloads a safety backup before receiving, refreshes the preview, and leaves needs-review records untouched.
- Tap Send Sync Records, confirm the warning, and confirm safe sync records upload while any needs-review records are left untouched.
- Tap Preview Sync again and confirm it reports no records needing upload or receive.
- On another device, tap Preview Sync, then Receive Sync Records. Confirm a safety backup downloads first, local records are not sent, needs-review records are left untouched, and only safe-receive records are applied.
- Tap Send Backup to Cloud, confirm the warning, and confirm it reports a server revision without pulling, merging, restoring, or changing local passage data.
- Tap Refresh Cloud Backups and confirm it lists recent cloud backup summaries without downloading, restoring, or changing local passage data.
- Tap Download Backup for a listed cloud backup and confirm a JSON file downloads without restoring or changing local passage data.
- Tap Restore Backup for a listed cloud backup, confirm both warnings, confirm a safety backup downloads first, and confirm the selected backup restores while the device keeps its own `steeler_device_id_v1`.

## Data Safety / Recovery Checks

- Confirm corrupt JSON handling offers to export the raw stored value before recovery.
- Confirm last-known-good mirror keys remain separate from the canonical localStorage keys.
- Confirm restoring a last-known-good mirror does not rename storage keys or change data shape.
- Confirm `?reset=1` clears only service-worker/cache storage and does not delete localStorage.

## Core Manual Regression Checks

Run these before a v1.0.0-facing release:

- Create a new passage.
- Add origin, destination, and transit ports.
- Save plan and confirm tide stations, comms/pilotage, and plan summary.
- Add Detailed Passage Plan waypoints and recalculate.
- Import a GPX file if available.
- Add Engine Start, Slip, manual underway entry, Dock, and Shutdown entries.
- Confirm EC start/end SMS text generation still opens the SMS flow.
- For a multi-leg passage, confirm EC start SMS mentions the transit stop and active leg, and non-final EC end SMS says another start message will follow.
- Save a Detailed Passage Plan as a reusable template, apply it to another leg after confirmation, and delete the template.
- Confirm DPP Hazards, Ports of Refuge and Crew Welfare remain separate per leg.
- Confirm Manage Ports coordinate links open Apple Maps and Apple Maps-style decimal coordinates can be pasted into coordinate fields.
- Fetch weather online, then confirm typed weather remains usable offline.
- Paste tide data into a tide station.
- Export CSV and PDF/print.
- Toggle day/night mode.

## Tagging

After the release commit is merged or accepted:

```sh
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Do not create a GitHub tag whose version disagrees with `APP_VERSION` or `CACHE_NAME`.
